Default no IP address but DHCP is set

Restore Factory Settings
   Put paper clip into pin hole on back for 10 seconds
   The OBi will reboot

To Assign IP Address
   Hook phone to outgoing phone port and ethernet to a hub
      Dial ***4
      and follow the menu
        1 to change
        192*168*0*20#

   Note: If I didn't have the OBI connected to a hub, it wouldn't
         save the IP Address???
