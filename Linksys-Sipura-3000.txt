Linksys - sipura 3000 FXS FXO

I haven't found a example using Asterisk only that does
an Outbound and Inbound trunks for a landline and 
modifies sip.conf and extensions.conf

Therefore if you wish a Press N to continue type
of interaction with all calls, I would just use
FreeBPX.

Create an extension on the Linksys FXO 
then in FreePBX
   1) Create a matching extension
       Application->Extensions->SIP
   2) Upload a Sound file
       Admin->System Recording
   3) Create a IVR (Interactive Voice Response/Auto-Attendant Greeting)
       Application->IVR
