How can I run Asterisk w/out FreePBX
	If the FreePBX GUI is not needed and should be prevented from overwriting the 
        Asterisk config files, it can be disabled (without deinstalling it):

	$ systemctl disable freepbx

	Apache can also be disabled if the GUI is not needed at all:

	$ systemctl disable apache2

	This file needs to be downloaded and placed in /etc/init.d/:
	http://repo.raspbx.org/download/asterisk

	$ chmod 755 /etc/init.d/asterisk
	$ systemctl enable asterisk

	This is a startup script from contrib/init.d from the Asterisk sources. On reboot, 
        Asterisk starts directly, without using the amportal startup script from FreePBX. 
        After making these changes, a complete reboot is required.
