Configure Asterisk to use SIP instead of PJSIP
   
   You have to modify FreePBX
   http://YOURPBXIPADDRESS
      admin:admin

   In FreePBX click Settings -> SIP Settings -> Sip Legacy Settings [chan_sip]
      Bind Port is the port number you need to use.

   Click on Sip Settings [chan_pjsip]
      Make sure the bind port is different than the SIP bind port.

   Apply the Configuration change

   See if the change was successful
   $ sudo lsof -i:5060
        > COMMAND  PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
        > asterisk 975 root   19u  IPv4  21599      0t0  UDP *:sip

Do you wish to still run FreePBX and apache since you're not using them?
    $ sudo systemctl disable freepbx
    $ sudo systemctl disable apache2

    created /etc/init.d/asterisk from http://repo.raspbx.org/download/asterisk
    $ chomd 755 /etc/init.d/asterisk
    $ sudo systemctl endable asterisk

Are you a security nut and wish to disable WiFi and Blu-tooth?

    $ sudo vi /boot/config.txt

    Append these two lines to the file
    dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt
    dtoverlay=pi3-disable-wifi

    $ sudo systemctl disable hciuart

Back up sip.conf, extensions.conf and voicemail.conf

Place new version of sip.conf, extensions.conf and voicemail.conf

Place sound files in the correct place
      Note1: My initial plan was to use one VOIP phone to replace the
            answering machine therefore one message for the entire
            system. Not using at the current time because Mom didn't
            like. But I'm migrating it for the future.
      Note2: created a sound file like
             "End robocaller, solicitation, and hangup calls with Asterisk & Raspberry Pi"
             to play when a non approved call is received. They must 
             press a 1 to continue.

   $ cd /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/en/
   $ rm vm-intro.*
   $ mkdir custom
   $ cd custom
   $ cp ~/my-vm-intro.gsm .
   $ cp ~/my-no-solicitors.gsm .
   $ chown -R asterisk.asterisk /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/en/custom/
   $ cp my-vm-intro.gsm ../vm-intro.gsm
   $ cd

Tried to place my one script in /home/asterisk/scripts/ but
the permissions kept getting changed on reboot.
