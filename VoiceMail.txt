I do Not know how big of a micro SD card you will need in your situation,
Number of mail boxes & your volume of messages.


If there is only one voicemail box on the system, I would remove
all vm-intro.* from /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/en/ and make your own.
I would personalize the message too.
    ex: You have reach 867-5309. We are unable to take your call.
        Please leave a message.


When the 'VoiceMail' command is execute, in this example for user 1000
    same => n,VoiceMail(1000@VoiceMail)

it plays
   vm-intro.gsm
   beep.gsm
   auth-thankyou.gsm


If you have set up your VOIP phone id to be equal to your user id,
you basically need to do
---append to bottom of extensions.conf---

[internal]
exten => *,1,VoiceMailMain(${CALLERID(num)}@VoiceMail)

---append to bottom of sip.conf---

[1000]
type=friend
secret=1                 ; password
context=internal
host=dynamic
mailbox=1000@VoiceMail

---

Yes, my mother did not like typing '*' then '1' for the password to 
get to the VoiceMail mailbox!
